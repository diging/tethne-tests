We start our investigation by formulating a multiscale model of the evolutionary dynamics of a population of cells. Our cells are characterised by a genotype-phenotype map: their chances of survival under selective pressure are determined by their phenotypes, whereas the latter are determined their genotypes. According to our multiscale dynamics, the population dynamics generates the evolution of a genotype-phenotype network. Our representation of the genotype-phenotype network is similar to previously described ones, but has a novel element, namely, our network contains two types of nodes: genotype and phenotype nodes. This network representation allows us to characterise robustness and evolvability in terms of its topological properties: phenotypic robustness by means of the clustering coefficient of the phenotype nodes, and evolvability as the emergence of giant connected component which allows navigation between phenotypes. This topological definition of evolvability allows us to characterise the so-called robustness of evolvability, which is defined in terms of the robustness against attack (i.e. edge removal) of the giant connected component. An investigation of the factors that affect the robustness of evolvability shows that phenotypic robustness and the cryptic genetic variation are key to the integrity of the ability to innovate. These results fit within the framework of a number of models which point out that robustness favours rather than hindering evolvability. We further show that the corresponding phenotype network, defined as the one-component projection of the whole genotype-phenotype network, exhibits the small-world phenomenon, which implies that in this type of evolutionary system the rate of adaptability is enhanced. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex networks; Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRN); Modeling; Percolation","evolutionary theory; genetic analysis; genetic variation; genotype; modeling; phenotype; population genetics; topology; article; cell population; cell proliferation; cell survival; evolutionary adaptation; gene activation; gene control; gene expression; gene interaction; gene mutation; gene regulatory network; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; phenotypic plasticity; population dynamics; priority journal; protein interaction",,,,,"2009SGR345, Generalitat de Catalunya","Aguirre, J., Buldú, J.M., Stich, M., Manrubia, S.C., Topological sturcture of the space of phneotypes. the case of RNA neutral networks (2011) PLoS One, 6, pp. e26324; Alarcón, T., Byrne, H.M., Maini, P.K., A multiple scale model of tumour growth (2005) Multiscale Model.

The phenotypic plasticity in snake venom proteomes together with their inherent toxin proteoform diversity, points out to the use of integrative analysis in order to better understand their actual complexity. In this regard, such a systems venomics task should encompass the integration of data from transcriptomic and proteomic studies (specially the venom gland proteome), the identification of biological PTMs, and the estimation of artifactual proteomes and peptidomes generated by sample handling procedures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the latter is often considered an oversimplified solution, individual-centred models are characterized by a degree of complexity that often restricts their use to scientists specialized in pastures modelling or in crop-weed interaction. In this study, an intermediate solution is presented (CoSMo), based on two assumptions allowing the use of a single instance of a generic crop model to simulate phytocoenosis dynamics and productivity. The first is that community parameters can be derived at each time step from the relative presence of the different species and from parameter values determined for the species in monoculture. The second is that inter-specific competition and changes in species relative presence can be simulated as a function of species-specific responses to hierarchically arranged drivers (triggered and continuous) representing the suitability of the different species to the conditions explored at each time step. CoSMo was here analyzed by means of three simulation experiments, where changes in the relative presence of three species with different traits and the productivity of the community were simulated under current conditions and future climate projections. Results encourage further studies, given that the solution proposed is easy to implement and parameterize, and leaves users free to work with the generic crop simulator they are familiar with. These features make CoSMo suitable for being coupled - within integrated studies - to models developed for other domains by scientists not specialist in the ecophysiological aspects involved with inter-specific competition. However, this approach cannot be considered as an alternative to individual-centred models in case of in silico studies explicitly focusing on the relationships between inter-specific competition and species traits and phenotypic plasticity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Grassland; Individual-centred models; Inter-specific competition; Pastures; Phytocoenosis","Crops; Plants (botany); Productivity; Simulators; Future climate projections; Grassland; Grassland productivity; Inter-specific competitions; Pastures; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiological features; Phytocoenosis; Physiological models; biological production; climate conditions; community dynamics; ecological modeling; grassland; individual-based model; morphology; parameterization; plant community; relative abundance; simulator",,,,,,"Baumann, D.T., Bastiaans, L., Goudriaan, J., van Laar, H.H., Kropff, M.J., Analysing crop yield and plant quality in an intercropping system using an eco-physiological model for interplant competition (2002) Agric.

ARTs, sometimes accompanying morphological dimorphism among males, are taxonomically widespread, especially common in arthropods. Here we review the current knowledge on ARTs and male dimorphism in a diverse but relatively overlooked group of arachnids, the order Opiliones, popularly known as harvestmen or daddy long-legs. We begin with a summary of harvestman mating systems, followed by a review of the two lines of evidence for the presence of ARTs in the group: (1) morphological data from natural populations and museum collections; and (2) behavioral information from field studies. Despite receiving less attention than spiders, scorpions and insects, our review shows that harvestmen are an exciting group of organisms that are potentially great models for sexual selection studies focused on ARTs. We also suggest that investigating the proximate mechanisms underlying male dimorphism in the order would be especially important. New research on ARTs and male dimorphism will have implications for our understanding of the evolution of mating systems, sperm competition, and polyandry.

Especially, we consider whether and how a differentiation of phenotypic plasticity can emerge under the assumption that there are no initial asymmetric relationships among coevolving species. We construct a minimal model where several different species participate in a partitioning of their shared niches, and evolve their behavioral plasticity to avoid an overlap of their niche use. By conducting evolutionary experiments with various conditions of the number of species and niches, we show that the two different types of asymmetric distributions of phenotypic plasticity emerge depending on the settings of the degree of congestion of the shared niches. In both cases, all species tended to obtain the similar amount of fitness regardless of such differences in their plasticity. We also show that the emerged distributions are coevolutionarily stable in general. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based model; Character displacement; Genetic algorithm; Learning; Multi-species interactions","coevolution; fitness; genetic algorithm; phenotypic plasticity; theoretical study; article; avoidance behavior; coevolution; controlled study; ecological niche; mathematical model; organismal interaction; phenotypic plasticity; priority journal; resource partitioning; species difference; sympatry",,,,,,"Abrams, P., The theory of limiting similarity (1983) Annu.

We expected not only an increase in body size (Bergmann's rule), but also an increase in relative heart weight with increasing elevation (Hesse's rule). Location: The Bohemian Forest, south-eastern Germany. Methods: We measured body length, body mass, and mass of the heart, lung, liver, kidneys and spleen of 386 adult specimens (188 of A flavicollis and 198 of M. glareolus) from 28 localities at 300-1450 m a.s.l., and also recorded the number of ectoparasites. We analysed body length using linear mixed models, with site as a random factor and species, sex, population density and elevation as fixed factors, and included all two-way interactions between species and the remaining fixed variables. For the organ masses, we included body length and body mass in the calculations to account for allometric variation of organ mass with body size. For a subset of individuals, we sequenced the mitochondrial D-loop to analyse genetic variation along the elevational gradient. Results: For both species, we found no support for Bergmann's rule. The body size of A. flavicollis even decreased with elevation. In contrast, the relative heart weight of both species significantly increased with elevation, thereby supporting Hesse's rule. Lung mass also increased with elevation. The mass of other internal organs showed no such consistent relationship with elevation. Neither species showed genetic differentiation across the elevational gradient. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that both rodent species respond to increasing elevation by decreasing overall energy expenditure and by increasing overall aerobic capacity. In the context of climate change, our results indicate that biogeographers should pay more attention to the potential significance of genetic and/or phenotypic plasticity of relative organ mass to environmental heterogeneity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Apodemus flavicollis; Bergmann's rule; Body size; Ecogeographical rules; Germany; Heart size; Hesse's rule; Myodes glareolus; Phenotypic plasticity; Rodentia",,,,,,,,"Müller, J.; National Park Bavarian Forest, Freyungerstr. 2, 94481 Grafenau, Germanyemail: joerg.mueller@npv-bw.bayern.de",,,,,,,,03050270,,JBIOD,10.1111/jbi.12365,,"English","J.

We examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with 2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen experienced an advantage or disadvantage in ""mixed"" associations. The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating. © The Author 2013.","Ant foundress associations; Cooperation; Interacting phenotypes; Pleometrosis; Social dynamics; Social phenotype; Social selection","ant; cheating behavior; cooperative behavior; entomology; eusociality; fitness; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; queen; social behavior; survival",,,,,"IOS-0446415, NSF, National Science Foundation","Agrawal, A.F., Brodie III, E.D., Wade, M.J., On indirect genetic effects in structured populations (2001) Am Nat., 158, pp. 308-323; Antal, T., Ohtsuki, H., Wakeley, J., Taylor, P.D., Nowak, M.A., Evolution of cooperation by phenotypic similarity (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., 106, pp. 8597-8600; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science., 211, pp. 1390-1396; Bernasconi, G., Strassmann, J.E., Cooperation among unrelated individuals: The ant foundress case (1999) TREE, 14, pp. 477-482; Bijma, P., Muir, W.M., Ellen, E.D., Wolf, J.B., Van Arendonk, J.A.M., Multilevel selection 2: Estimating the genetic parameters determining inheritance and response to selection (2007) Genetics., 175, pp. 289-299; Bijma, P., Wade, M.J., The joint effects of kin, multilevel selection and indirect genetic effects on response to genetic selection (2008) J Evol Biol., 21, pp. 1175-1188; Bleakley, B.H., Brodie III, E.D., Indirect genetic effects influence antipredator behavior in guppies: Estimates of the coefficient of interaction psi and the inheritance of reciprocity (2009) Evol., 63, pp. 1796-1806; Brown, J.S., Vincent, T.L., Evolution of cooperation with shared costs and benefits (2008) Proc R Soc London, ser B., 275, pp. 1985-1994; Camazine, S., Deneubourg, J.-L., Franks, N.R., Sneyd, J., Theraulaz, G., Bonabeau, E., (2001) Self-organization in Biological Systems, , Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press; Chenoweth, S.F., Rundle, H.D., Blows, M.W., Experimental evidence for the evolution of indirect genetic effects: Changes in the interaction effect coefficient, psi (ψ), due to sexual selection (2010) Evol., 64, pp. 1849-1856; Cole, B., The ecological setting of social evolution: The demography of ant populations (2009) Organization of Insect Societies: From Genome to Sociocomplexity, pp. 74-104. , In: Gadau J, Fewell JH, editors.

Two important sources of this variation are behavioral plasticity (adaptive variation in behavior) and behavioral type (i.e., an individual with consistent behavioral differences across one or more situations). Although oviposition-site selection (OS) is widespread and affects both parents and offspring, it has been overlooked in the context of the behavioral type. Thus, we used the Texas field cricket (Gryllus texensis) to determine if OS could be integrated into the behavioral type paradigm and if a relevant environmental variable (food limitation) influences behavioral type. We found that behavioral type was consistent across contexts because individuals exhibiting riskier (bolder) behavior in a novel environment also exhibited riskier behavior during oviposition. Also, individuals traded off safety with food availability during oviposition - that is, fasted crickets were more likely to choose food over safety (shelter) when making an oviposition decision. Last, relative to fed crickets, those that were fasted oviposited fewer eggs during overnight trials in which food was available. By integrating a behavior tightly linked to multigenerational fitness with an established behavioral assay (behavior to novel stimuli), we show that behavioral type can be both consistent across contexts and plastic in response to a ubiquitous environmental factor (food limitation). © The Author 2014.","Behavioral syndrome; Behavioral type; Cricket; Parental care; Predation; Reproduction","adaptation; cricket; decision making; entomology; environmental factor; food limitation; individual variation; oviposition; phenotypic plasticity; predation; site selection; trade-off",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Kovalko, I., Mosher, B., Forthcoming.

However, such studies are extremely rare at the continental scale because of limited observations and potential collinearity and spatial autocorrelation among abiotic factors that can make the attribution difficult. This study was designed to explore and quantify environmental variables that could closely relate to soybean phenotypic traits across China. The data of cultivated soybean phenotypic traits (i.e., 100-seed weight, crude oil content, protein content, plant height) and environmental variables were compiled from 18,686 samples across 29 provinces of China. Different regression models were used to remove collinearity and spatial autocorrelation among selected variables. As the first attempt at a continental scale, our study shows that climatic and geographic variables contributed much more to trait variations than soils did, of which the minimum temperature was most critical, followed by longitude, and soil properties explained more variances on crude protein content than on others. Abiotic variables explained 29, 20, 17 and 38% of the observed variations (P<. 0.05) of crude protein content, crude oil content, 100-seed weight and plant height, respectively. This result implies that, besides the effects of farming practices such as fertilization, irrigation, planting density, etc., biotic factors (e.g., genes) likely play a more important role in determining the phenotypic traits and their spatial variability. It is possible to improve soybean quality and yield by selecting suitable environments even though it is hard to develop a kind of soybean varieties with all ideal germplasm traits simultaneously. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Accession; Crude oil content; Crude protein content; Environmental variables; Phenotypic traits; Regression models; Seed weight; Soybean germplasm","autocorrelation; crop yield; farming system; geographical variation; phenotypic plasticity; protein; soybean; spatial variation; temperature effect; China; Glycine max",,,,,"40971125, NSFC, National Natural Science Foundation of China","Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., (1998) Crop evapotranspiration: Guidelines for computing crop water requirements, FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, , FAO, Rome, Italy; Anselin, L., Under the hood issues in the specification and interpretation of spatial regression models (2002) Agric.

However, the rapidly expanding research literature on the impacts of anthropogenic noise (a recently recognized global pollutant) tends to focus on the benefits likely to be accrued by any resulting behavioral adaptations or plasticity. In particular, although studies investigating acoustic communication (the topic receiving the most attention to date) invariably discuss, and occasionally attempt to measure, the perceived benefits in terms of reduced masking that might arise from vocal adjustments by signalers, only rarely are the potential fitness costs even mentioned. The bias toward benefits prevents a full understanding of the consequences of anthropogenic noise, including the implications for population viability and community structure. Here, we argue for a greater consideration of fitness costs, outline a number of specific examples (reduced transmission distances, increased risk of predation/parasitism, altered energy budgets, loss of vital information), make suggestions about how to move forward, and showcase why a balanced view is as crucial in this field as any other aspect of behavioral ecology. © The Author 2013.","Acoustic communication; Anthropogenic noise; Costs and benefits; Fitness; Trade-offs; Vocalizations","anthropogenic effect; behavioral ecology; bioacoustics; energy budget; fitness; noise; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; trade-off",,,,,,"Ballentine, B., Hyman, J., Nowicki, S., Vocal performance influences female response to male bird song: An experimental test (2004) Behav Ecol., 15, pp. 163-168; Banks, A.J., Martin, T.E., Host activity and the risk of nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (2001) Behav Ecol., 12, pp. 31-40; Barber, J.R., Crooks, K.R., Fristrup, K.M., The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms (2009) Trends Ecol Evol., 25, pp. 180-189; Bejder, L., Samuels, A., Whitehead, H., Finn, H., Allen, S., Impact assessment research: Use and misuse of habituation, sensitisation and tolerance in describing wildlife responses to anthropogenic stimuli (2009) Mar Ecol Prog Ser., 395, pp. 177-185; Blickley, J.L., Blackwood, D., Patricelli, G.L., Experimental evidence for the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise on abundance of greater sage-grouse at leks (2012) Conserv Biol., 26, pp. 461-471; Brown, T.J., Handford, P., Why birds sing at dawn: The role of consistent song transmission (2003) Ibis., 145, pp. 120-129; Brumm, H., Ritschard, M., Song amplitude affects territorial aggression of male receivers in chaffinches (2011) Behav Ecol., 22, pp. 310-316; Brumm, H., Slabbekoorn, H., Acoustic communication in noise (2005) Adv Study Behav., 35, pp. 151-209; Brumm, H., Zollinger, S.A., The evolution of the Lombard effect: 100 years of psychoacoustic research (2011) Behaviour., 148, pp. 1173-1198; Catchpole, C.K., Slater, P.J.B., (2008) Bird Song: Biological Themes and Variations, , Cambridge (MA): Cambridge University Press; Eens, M., Rivera-Gutierrez, H.F., Pinxten, R., Are low-frequency songs sexually selected, and do they lose their potency in male-female interactions under noisy conditions?

Successful dispersal depends on a complex blend of decisions at all main stages of the dispersal process: emigration, prospection for a site, and settling. Costs and benefits of such decisions are expected to depend on sex and on the ecological context, on individual physiological state, and on concomitant decisions by relatives, which affect competition with kin and inbreeding. We analyzed natal dispersal propensity (i.e., dispersing or not) and dispersal distance in the semicolonial barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) in relation to context-, phenotype-, and kin-dependent factors. Females had larger dispersal propensity and distance than males. Dispersal propensity of both sexes was negatively density dependent and was less likely from colonies (farms) with large number of livestock, which is important to barn swallow distribution. Dispersal propensity was larger among males ranking high in the body mass brood hierarchy and smaller among late-hatched females. Dispersal distance was larger for late-hatched males and for females that ranked high in the body mass brood hierarchy. Finally, both dispersal propensity and distance of males increased with the number of male siblings. We, thus, identified several context-, phenotype-, and kin-dependent components of dispersal decisions. Phenotype-dependent effects suggest that decisions of whether to disperse and of dispersal distance are different processes under control of sex-specific traits. Finally, male dispersal behavior suggests that kin selection favors males that reduce the risk of sib-sib mating competition, in a population with male-biased tertiary sex ratio. © The Author 2013.","Body mass; Dispersal; Habitat quality; Hatching date; Sex","avifauna; body mass; colony; decision making; habitat quality; hatching date; inbreeding; interspecific competition; kin selection; life history trait; natal dispersal; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; sex ratio; sibling",,,,,,"Altwegg, R., Ringsby, T.H., Sæther, B.-H., Phenotypic correlates and consequences of dispersal in a metapopulation of house sparrows Passer domesticus (2000) J Anim Ecol., 69, pp. 762-770; Ambrosini, R., Bolzern, A.M., Canova, L., Arieni, S., Møller, A.P., Saino, N., The distribution and colony size of barn swallows in relation to agricultural land use (2002) J Appl Ecol., 39, pp. 524-534; Ambrosini, R., Rubolini, D., Trovò, P., Liberini, G., Bandini, M., Romano, A., Sicurella, B., Saino, N., Maintenance of livestock farming may buffer population decline of the barn swallow hirundo rustica (2012) Bird Conserv Int., 22, pp. 411-428; Ambrosini, R., Saino, N., Environmental effects at two nested spatial scales on habitat choice and breeding performance of barn swallow (2010) Evol Ecol., 24, pp. 491-508; Badyaev, A.V., Maternal effects as generators of evolutionary change: A reassessment (2008) The Year in Evolutionary Biology 2008, pp. 151-161. , In: Schlichting CD, Mousseau TA, editors.

Selective pressures for resource competition differ at different stages of life and between sexes; therefore, coloration is expected to vary between juveniles and adults and between males and females. Exploring the covariance between coloration and other traits may help to understand the functional significance of color and the action of natural selection on multivariate phenotypes. Melanin-based plumage coloration was investigated in the masked booby Sula dactylatra in relation to melanin concentration, sex, hormone levels, and shy-bold behavior of chicks close to fledging. Darker brown boobies showed higher levels of both eumelanin and pheomelanin concentration and lower body mass. Males behaved bolder than females and showed on average 8% larger brown patches. Bolder females had smaller brown patches. Bolder individuals also had lower levels of circulating testosterone, but no differences in corticosterone levels were found. Stronger phenotypic integration was observed in females than males. Our study suggests that juvenile melanic coloration may reflect behavioral strategies by sex, endocrine profiles, and body mass indicating the convergence of different adaptive functions in a given phenotype, this being more evident in females. Direction of correlations differed from those predicted under the pleiotropic idea for color-related traits. These results suggest the possibility that juvenile plumage acts as a signaling system in a social context within the age class and suggest that plumage coloration may indicate different behavioral strategies. © The Author 2013.","Behavioral strategy; Corticosterone; Juvenile plumage; Melanin pigment; Personality; Pleiotropy; Sula dactylatra; Testosterone","age class; behavioral ecology; body mass; color; endocrine disruptor; eusociality; juvenile; life history trait; melanin; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; pleiotropy; plumage; resource allocation; seabird; testosterone",,,,,,"Adkins-Regan, E., (2005) Hormones and Animal Social Behavior, , Princeton and Oxford, UK: Princeton University Press; Alonso-Álvarez, C., Velando, A., Effect of testosterone on the behaviour of yellow-legged gulls (Larus cachinans) in a high-density colony during the courtship period (2001) Ethol Ecol Evol., 13, pp. 341-349; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton, UK: Princeton University Press; Arbuckle, J.L., (2010) IBM SPSS Amos 19 User's Guide, , Chicago (IL): SPSS Inc; Ariyomo, T.O., Carter, M., Watt, P.J., Heritability of boldness and aggressiveness in the zebrafish (2013) Behav Genet., 43, pp. 161-167; Badyaev, A.V., Growing apart: An ontogenetic perspective on the evolution of sexual size dimorphism (2002) Trends Ecol Evol., 17, pp. 369-378; Bagnara, J.T., Matsumoto, J., Ferris, W., Frost, S.K., Turner Jr., W.A., Tchen, T.T., Taylor, J.D., Common origin of pigment cells (1979) Science., 203, pp. 410-415; Bell, A.M., Hankison, S.J., Laskowski, K.L., The repeatability of behaviour: A meta-analysis (2009) Anim Behav., 77, pp. 771-783; Bergeon Burns, C.M., Rosvall, K.A., Ketterson, E.D., Neural steroid sensitivity and aggression: Comparing individuals of two songbird subspecies (2013) J Evol Biol., 26, pp. 820-831; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Behavioural causes and consequences of sexual size dimorphism (2005) Ethology., 111, pp. 977-1016; Blas, J., Baos, R., Bortolotti, G.R., Marchant, T.A., Hiraldo, F., Age-related variation in the adrenocortical response to stress in nestling white storks (Ciconia ciconia) supports the developmental hypothesis (2006) Gen Comp Endocrinol., 148, pp. 172-180; Bókony, V., Garamszegi, L.Z., Hirschenhauser, K., Liker, A., Testosterone and melanin-based black plumage coloration: A comparative study (2008) Behav Ecol Sociobiol., 62, pp. 1229-1238; Bortolotti, G.R., Evolution of growth rates in eagles: Sibling competition vs. Energy considerations (1986) Ecology., 67, pp. 182-194; Budaev, S.V., Sex differences in the big five personality factors: Testing an evolutionary hypothesis (1999) Pers Individ Dif., 26, pp. 801-813; Carter, A.J., Goldizen, A.W., Tromp, S.A., Agamas exhibit behavioral syndromes: Bolder males bask and feed more but may suffer higher predation (2010) Behav Ecol., 21, pp. 655-661; Catoni, C., Peters, A., Schaefer, H.M., Dietary flavonoids enhance conspicuousness of a melanin-based trait in male blackcaps but not of the female homologous trait or of sexually monochromatic traits (2009) J Evol Biol., 22, pp. 1649-1657; Cone, R.D., Studies on the physiological functions of the melanocortin system (2006) Endocr Rev., 27, pp. 736-749; Dall, S.R.X., Houston, A.I., McNamara, J.M., The behavioural ecology of personality: Consistent individual differences from an adaptive perspective (2004) Ecol Lett., 7, pp. 734-739; De Boer, S.F., Van Der-Vegt, B.J., Koolhaas, J.M., Individual variation in aggression of feral rodent strains: A standard for the genetics of aggression and violence?

Such plastic phenotypic responses have a great importance, from both the ecological and aquaculture point of view. The present study examined the effect of water temperature on the ontogeny and juvenile phenotype of Sparus aurata L. Six combinations of three temperatures (16, 19, and 22 °C) were applied during different phases of ontogeny up to the juvenile stage (ca 33-37 mm standard length, SL). Elevated temperature resulted in a relative acceleration of differentiation versus growth, which morphologically was evident as a significantly smaller SL (ca 11% decrease) at different ontogenetic events (development of fins, squamation and body shape). Moreover, geometric morphometric analysis clearly showed a significant effect of water temperature during early ontogeny on the juvenile body-shape. Thermally-induced variation of juvenile body shape was mainly expressed across the first canonical axis (56.4% explained variance), which discriminated the groups of highest temperatures from the rest. Water temperature mainly affected the position of the bases of supraoccipital and of basioccipital bones, of the upper jaw, as well as of the dorsal, anal and pelvic fins. The results are discussed with respect to the potential use of thermal manipulations during the hatchery phase to control the phenotype of S. aurata at the end of on-growing phase, i.e. at commercial size. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

If species use different cues or respond at different rates, this could result in asynchrony between hosts and herbivores. The larval stage of the endemic critically endangered Sinai Baton Blue butterfly (Pseudophilotes sinaicus) feeds exclusively on the buds and flowers of an endangered near-endemic plant, the Sinai Thyme (Thymus decussatus), with a narrow window in time when both larvae and flowers are present. We test for synchrony in time and space between the flowering phenology of the host plant and the associated timings and abundances of the Sinai Baton Blue. Together with significant spatial variation amongst patches, there were large inter-annual variations in flowering period, up to two weeks between years, indicating phenotypic plasticity in response to abiotic conditions. The butterfly flight period was approximately synchronised to the flowering of its host plant, but there was no evidence of any detailed spatial or temporal correlations in phenology. The dramatic annual population changes, possibly cycles, in the butterfly, may partly be driven by differences in the responses between plant and herbivore to climate that cause varying degrees of synchrony between years.

Chemotherapies,targeted therapies and immunotherapies can successfully achieve remissions in cancer patients, but durable responses are rare. Although the mechanisms of diverse therapies vary,plasticity alteration of tumor and immune cells in response to therapy-induced tumor tissue injury and inflammation contributes to the development of drug resistance. This review summarizes research progress in the adaptive phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells and immune cells during tumor progression as well as the successful combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment to tackle resistance.","Cellular plasticity;

Complex life histories, ambiguous taxonomic characters, and phenotypic plasticity pose serious problems for accurate species-level identifications and future revisions of Clytia species. In the present study, morphological investigations and molecular analyses of Clytia specimens from the coastal waters of the East China Sea revealed Clytia gulangensis sp. nov. as a new species. DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene supported the new species as a separate species within Clytia, and phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial 16S rDNA and nuclear 18S rDNA further confirmed this new species to be a distinct lineage. Moreover, detailed observation of medusae and polyps of this species showed sufficient morphological differences from other Clytia species for a diagnosis. Our results indicated that life cycle and DNA-based studies should be a standard approach in future biodiversity investigations of Clytia species.

We estimated the rate of degradation of chemical cues generated by Aeshna dragonfly larvae feeding on Rana temporaria tadpoles. The half-life of the cue was 35 h and was not influenced by whether it was aged in pond water or tap water or whether other tadpoles were present in the container in which cue-aging occurred. A review of other published estimates of predator cue half-life revealed values of 0.2-126 h, and variation among studies was unrelated to the type of aging water, the venue in which water was aged or prey behavior observed (laboratory, field), or the type of behavior that was recorded.

Some of them are specifically expressed in muscle while others have a broader tissue expression but are still involved in establishing the muscle phenotype. In teleosts, water temperature markedly affects embryonic development and larval growth. It has been previously shown that higher embryonic temperatures promoted faster development and increased size of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae relatively to a lower temperature. The role of miRNAs in thermal-plasticity of growth is hitherto unknown. Hence, we have used high-throughput SOLiD sequencing to determine potential changes in the miRNA transcriptome in Senegalese sole embryos that were incubated at 15oC or 21oC until hatching and then reared at a common temperature of 21oC. Results: We have identified 320 conserved miRNAs in Senegalese sole, of which 48 had not been previously described in teleosts. mir-17a-5p, mir-26a, mir-130c, mir-206-3p, mir-181a-5p, mir-181a-3p and mir-199a-5p expression levels were further validated by RT- qPCR. The majority of miRNAs were dynamically expressed during early development, with peaks of expression at pre-metamorphosis or metamorphosis. Also, a higher incubation temperature (21oC) was associated with expression of some miRNAs positively related with growth (e.g., miR-17a, miR-181-5p and miR-206) during segmentation and at hatching. Target prediction revealed that these miRNAs may regulate myogenesis through MAPK and mTOR pathways. Expression of miRNAs involved in lipid metabolism and energy production (e.g., miR-122) also differed between temperatures. A miRNA that can potentially target calpain (miR-181-3p), and therefore negatively regulate myogenesis, was preferentially expressed during segmentation at 15oC compared to 21oC. Conclusions: Temperature has a strong influence on expression of miRNAs during embryonic and larval development in fish. Higher expression levels of miR-17a, miR-181-5p and miR-206-3p and down-regulation of miR-181a-3p at 21oC may promote myogenesis and are in agreement with previous studies in Senegalese sole, which reported enhanced growth at higher embryonic temperatures compared to 15oC. Moreover, miRNAs involved in lipid metabolism and energy production may also contribute to increased larval growth at 21oC compared to 15oC. Taken together, our data indicate that miRNAs may play a role in temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of growth in teleosts.",,,,,,,,,"Campos, C.",,,,,,,,14712164,,,10.1186/1471-2164-15-525,,"English",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902915901

It is reported here that in adult or weanling Syrian hamsters, relative to social housing (SH), social separation (SS) induced anorexia characterized as hypophagia, weight loss, reduced adiposity, and hypermetabolism. Following anorexia, SS increased reluctance to feed, and thigmotaxis, in anxiogenic environments. Importantly, anorexia and anxiety were induced post-puberty with female biases. SS also reduced hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing factor mRNA and serum corticosteroid levels assessed by RT-PCR and RIA, respectively. Consistent with the view that sex differences in adrenal suppression contributed to female biases in anorexia and anxiety by disinhibiting neuroimmune activity, SS elevated hypothalamic interleukin-6 and toll-like receptor 4 mRNA levels. Although corticosteroids were highest during SH, they were within the physiological range and associated with juvenile-like growth of white adipose, bone, and skeletal muscle. These results suggest that hamsters exhibit plasticity in bioenergetic and emotional phenotypes across puberty without an increase in stress responsiveness. Thus, social separation of hamsters provides a model of sex differences in anorexia and anxiety during adulthood and their pathogeneses during adolescence. © 2014.","Corticosteroids; Corticotropin-releasing factor;

Evolutionary theory predicts that gape-limited predators, such as rattlesnakes, should possess plasticity in their trophic morphology to allow them to respond to environmental cues about their prey base. This study examined the effects of two possible influences over trophic morphology in the pit-viper Crotalus viridis viridis. Snakes from six litters were exposed to diet manipulations performed over 480 days. By day 480, snakes from two prey-size treatments exhibited significantly different head shapes. Snakes reared on whole rodents had broader heads, whereas snakes force-fed homogenized prey had narrower heads. Shape differences varied among litters, suggesting that not all litters responded the same to diet manipulations. Results suggest that trophic morphology of rattlesnakes is plastic, at least in some litters, and can be induced by prey items. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Allometric relationship; Gape-limitation; Head shape",,,,,,,,"Smith, M.T.; Department of Biological Sciences, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58108-6050email: rattlesnake.research@gmail.com",,,,,,,,03622525,,JOMOA,10.1002/jmor.20305,,"English","J.
